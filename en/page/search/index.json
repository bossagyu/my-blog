[{"content":"Overview This article explains how to easily set up a TypeScript development environment using Volta, with MacOS as the target platform.\nWhat is Volta? Volta is a version management tool for Node.js, featuring the following characteristics as presented on Volta\u0026rsquo;s official site:\nFast: Built in Rust, enabling swift Node.js version switching. Reliable: Ensures everyone on a project uses the same tools. Universal: Can be used across package managers, node runtimes, and OSes. While nodebrew has been commonly used, the use of Volta seems to be increasing lately.\nInstalling Volta and Node.js Installing Volta is as simple as running the following command:\n1 curl https://get.volta.sh | bash If you\u0026rsquo;re using zsh and the path hasn\u0026rsquo;t been automatically set, use the following commands:\n1 2 3 echo \u0026#39;VOLTA_HOME=$HOME/.volta\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.zshrc echo \u0026#39;export PATH=$VOLTA_HOME/bin:$PATH\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.zshrc source ~/.zshrc Verify the installation. If a version is displayed, Volta has been successfully installed:\n1 volta -v Next, use Volta to install Node.js. If no version is specified, the latest LTS version will be installed:\n1 volta install node Installing yarn and Creating a TypeScript Project Differences between npm and yarn Both npm and yarn are package managers for Node.js. Their features include:\nnpm:\nReleased a year after Node.js (2010). Stands for Node Package Manager. Automatically generates a package-lock.json file. Installed automatically with Node.js. yarn:\nReleased in 2016. Developed by Facebook, Google, Exponent, and Tilde. Compatible with npm (can use the same package.json). More strict in locking module versions than npm. Faster installation than npm. While yarn appears superior, recent updates to npm have minimized the differences. Here, we will use yarn to create a TypeScript project.\nInstalling yarn Install yarn using Volta:\n1 volta install yarn Confirm the installation by checking if yarn is listed:\n1 volta list Creating a TypeScript Project Initialize yarn:\n1 yarn init -y Install Node.js:\n1 volta pin node@20.0.0 Install TypeScript:\n1 yarn add typescript Install ts-node:\n1 yarn add --dev ts-node Create a tsconfig.json file. This is a TypeScript configuration file that details compilation settings. In this case, you can leave it at the default settings generated:\n1 yarn tsc --init Test a sample program:\n1 2 3 4 echo \u0026#34;console.log(\u0026#39;Hello, TypeScript!\u0026#39;);\u0026#34; \u0026gt; hello.ts yarn ts-node hello.ts # If \u0026#34;Hello, TypeScript!\u0026#34; is displayed, it\u0026#39;s a success. The test script ran successfully. This completes the setup of the TypeScript development environment.\nSummary This article described how to set up a TypeScript development environment easily using Volta. By using Volta, managing Node.js versions becomes straightforward, making the development environment setup smoother. Additionally, specifying the Node.js version with Volta in your project\u0026rsquo;s package.json can help eliminate version discrepancies among developers, adding another layer of convenience to your workflow.\n","date":"2024-03-10T13:11:13+09:00","permalink":"https://bossagyu.com/en/blog/021-typescript-setup/","title":"Setting Up TypeScript Development Environment Easily with Volta"},{"content":"Overview This article explains capacity and performance management as outlined in ITIL v4. I will also apply what I have understood to my own experiences, explaining the process of capacity and performance management.\nWhat are Capacity and Performance Management? Capacity and Performance Management involves managing the performance of services and the resources supporting them. The goal is to optimize the performance of services and ensure that the capacity of services is appropriately maintained.\nProcesses in Capacity and Performance Management The processes in capacity and performance management include:\nEstablishing Capacity and Performance Control Analyzing and Improving Service Capacity and Performance Establishing Capacity and Performance Control Establishing capacity and performance control involves agreeing with stakeholders on the usage and performance standards for the IT resources used by the service, and deciding on the timing, baseline, and format for evaluation.\nIt is realized through the following steps:\nIdentifying service capacity and performance requirements Agreeing on service capacity and performance requirements Deciding on capacity and performance requirements Designing capacity and performance evaluation metrics and reports Applying my experiences to these processes, I understood them as follows:\nIdentifying service capacity and performance requirements As an internal platform provider, I identified latency performance requirements (99%ile in Nms) demanded by internal users. Based on these thresholds, we conducted performance verification and measured throughput per instance. We calculated the cost based on the throughput measurements. Agreeing on service capacity and performance requirements We agreed on latency performance and throughput with stakeholders. Deciding on capacity and performance requirements This remained unchanged from what was agreed upon. Designing capacity and performance evaluation metrics and reports We used a tracing tool called Dynatrace to measure and report performance. Analyzing and Improving Service Capacity and Performance Analyze issues in usage and performance conditions from service output logs and incident information.\nIt is realized through the following steps:\nAnalyzing capacity and performance Reporting capacity and performance Planning and designing capacity and performance Applying my experiences to these activities, I understood them as follows:\nAnalyzing capacity and performance We used Dynatrace to analyze latency performance and throughput. We identified performance issues from incident information. Reporting capacity and performance We visualized latency performance and throughput using Dynatrace\u0026rsquo;s dashboard. Planning and designing capacity and performance Anticipating growth in users, we forecasted that the current capacity would be insufficient. We made plans to increase capacity based on demand forecasts and executed them. Summary In this article, I explained capacity and performance management based on what I have learned and applied it to my own experiences. I understood that capacity and performance management involves managing aspects similar to availability management, but from the perspective of capacity and performance.\nIn my experience, discussions about performance and availability often go hand in hand, and I rarely deal with them independently.\n","date":"2024-02-27T08:53:36+09:00","permalink":"https://bossagyu.com/en/blog/020-itilv4-capacity-and-performance-management/","title":"Explaining Capacity and Performance Management in ITIL v4"},{"content":"Overview This article will guide you through installing Stable Diffusion Web UI on Mac and using it locally.\nWhat is Stable Diffusion?

The product lacked a clear strategy and direction, prompting me to develop a new product strategy.\nWhile developing the strategy, I realized that the term \u0026ldquo;strategy\u0026rdquo; is interpreted in various ways by different people, often used loosely in many contexts. To understand what constitutes a good strategy, I referred to \u0026ldquo;Good Strategy Bad Strategy.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat is a Good Strategy? A good strategy identifies critical points where concerted efforts can significantly boost the effect of one’s actions. A strategy should show the direction for an organization to move forward.\nA good strategy has three basic structures:\nDiagnosis Guiding Policy Actions Diagnosis Diagnosis involves assessing the situation to identify the key challenges to address. A good diagnosis separates crucial issues from the complex mix of problems and simplifies them.\nMost of the strategy work lies in figuring out what is happening. Gathering information is crucial. Although the book criticizes consultants\u0026rsquo; frameworks, I find them useful in organizing information after thorough collection.\nIn creating my product strategy, I used SWOT analysis and Impact Mapping to organize the current situation and the impact of existing strategies.\nFor more on these methods, refer to the following resources:\nSWOT Analysis Impact Mapping Guiding Policy The guiding policy outlines how to approach the challenges identified in the diagnosis. A good policy is not about goals or visions but about how to face challenges and exclude other options. It focuses efforts on a decisive point to achieve a significant effect.\nA good strategy clearly shows where resources will be allocated according to the strategy.\nIn my case, I defined the product direction based on the current situation and vision, focusing on specific target segments and values to offer.\nActions Actions are a coherent set of steps designed to execute the guiding policy. A strategy coordinates all actions to implement the policy effectively.\nA good strategy includes guidelines for implementing actions.\nMy Strategy Based on the above, I developed the following strategy (partially obscured as it was for my company):\n1 Reduce the new user cost of using xx function. This simple strategy meets the three basic structures of a good strategy:\nDiagnosis Identified increasing new users of xx as critical for the company\u0026rsquo;s benefit. Guiding Policy Decided to lower the onboarding cost to acquire new users. Actions Prioritized several approaches to realize the policy. Although it could have included more action-oriented words, I decided on the above. What is a Bad Strategy Finally, let\u0026rsquo;s touch on common patterns of bad strategies:\nCharacteristics of a Bad Strategy:\nVague Uses jargon or industry terms to obscure simple facts. Avoids Significant Problems Strategy should overcome difficult challenges and obstacles. Strategies focusing only on attainability are bad. Confuses Goals with Strategy For instance, a 10% revenue increase is a goal, not a strategy. Sets Wrong Strategic Objectives Strategies set without sufficient investigation of causes and surroundings. Summary This article summarized how to create a good product strategy based on \u0026ldquo;Good Strategy Bad Strategy.\u0026rdquo; Creating a good strategy might not happen at once. However, not having a strategy is like running blindly, unable to judge whether actions are successful or not.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to start with a basic strategy, constantly observe surroundings, and update the strategy to define the direction for your product and organization.\n","date":"2024-01-08T21:55:15+09:00","permalink":"https://bossagyu.com/en/blog/013-good-strategy-bad-strategy/","title":"How to Create a Product Strategy"},{"content":"Overview This article explains how to set up Twitter Social Cards for a blog created with Hugo.\nWhat is a Twitter Social Card?
