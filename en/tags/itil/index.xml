&lt;p>This article consolidates my learning and understanding of business analysis as per ITIL v4. I will also apply my own experiences to explain the business analysis process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-business-analysis">What is Business Analysis?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Business analysis involves analyzing a business or any other component to propose solutions for meeting those needs or solving business challenges. It is important to note that the term &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; analysis does not solely pertain to business entities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="examples-of-business-analysis-techniques">Examples of Business Analysis Techniques&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Examples of business analysis techniques include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>SWOT Analysis&lt;/li>
&lt;li>User Stories&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For specific methods, I defer to other sites as they are not the main focus here. Personally, I often use Customer Journey Maps, although it is not listed as an example here.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-business-analysis-process">The Business Analysis Process&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The business analysis process includes two main processes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Designing and Maintaining Business Analysis Approaches&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Identifying Business Analysis and Solutions&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="designing-and-maintaining-business-analysis-approaches">Designing and Maintaining Business Analysis Approaches&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This process focuses on establishing a consistent and effective approach to business analysis by addressing the current and anticipated needs of the organization. It is executed as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Analyzing the organization and requirements&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reviewing business analysis approach methodologies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implementing the business analysis approach&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In my organization, we rarely conduct analysis at the business layer level. Generally, this process involves analyzing specific requirements using certain methodologies.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="identifying-business-analysis-and-solutions">Identifying Business Analysis and Solutions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This process emphasizes analyzing stakeholders&amp;rsquo; needs and requirements. It includes identifying and proposing solutions to address the stakeholders&amp;rsquo; needs and requirements. It is executed as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Collecting and analyzing information from stakeholders&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Defining solution options and identifying recommended solutions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Providing support to the solution delivery team&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Evaluating and assessing the performance of the solution&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Applying my own experiences to these activities, I understood them as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="for-12">For 1,2&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Collecting information from stakeholders and conducting analysis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Identifying the issues to be solved (why) from the analysis results and determining what solutions are available (what).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="for-3">For 3&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Considering how to solve the identified why and what with the product team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deciding on the resolution method and evaluation criteria to determine how success will be measured.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="for-4">For 4&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Regularly evaluating how well the solution meets the established criteria.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I recommend automating data collection and visualizing it with tools like Grafana for visibility.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This article explained business analysis based on my learning and experiences. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve understood that business analysis does not only target businesses and includes processes beyond analysis.&lt;/p>
