## Overview
Adding a `.gitignore` file to a project allows you to exclude certain files and directories from being tracked by git. However, it can be tedious to repeatedly add default directories like `.idea` generated by IDEs to `.gitignore` for each new project. This article explains how to apply `.gitignore` settings globally across all projects.

## Applying gitignore Globally

Git by default checks for ignore settings in `~/.config/git/ignore`. Therefore, by placing your ignore configurations in this file, you can have them applied to all your projects.

While it's common to create a `.gitignore_global` and register it under `core.excludesfile`, this method requires unnecessary configuration in `.gitconfig`, which is why the approach described here is recommended.

## Steps to Apply gitignore Globally

### Create a Directory for Ignore File
Create a directory to store your ignore file, if it doesn't already exist:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.config/git/
```

### Create and Configure the Ignore File
Create the ignore file and write the patterns for files and directories you want to ignore globally:

```
vim ~/.config/git/ignore
```

Example of what to include:

```shell
.idea/
*.log
node_modules/
```

### Applying the Ignore Settings
These settings will now automatically apply to all projects managed under your user account. If there are already tracked files you wish to ignore, use `git rm --cached` to stop tracking them without deleting the files.

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage your ignore settings across all your git projects without having to replicate configurations in each project repository.
