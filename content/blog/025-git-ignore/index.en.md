## Overview
This article simplifies the process of adding directories like `.idea` which are automatically generated by IDEs to `.gitignore` by applying the settings globally, rather than per project.

## How to Apply gitignore Globally

Creating a `.gitignore_global` file and registering it with `core.excludesfile` is a common method, but git by default looks for ignore settings in `~/.config/git/ignore`.  
By placing your ignore settings into this file, you can apply them across all projects.

### Creating the Directory

First, create the directory if it doesn't already exist:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.config/git/
```

### Creating the ignore File

Next, create the ignore file and add the patterns you want to ignore universally:

```shell
vim ~/.config/git/ignore
```

Add entries like so:
```
.idea/
*.log
node_modules/
```

This setup negates the need to add extra configurations in `.gitconfig` which would be necessary if using `.gitignore_global`, making it a simpler and cleaner solution.
